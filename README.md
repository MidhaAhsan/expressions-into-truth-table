# expressions-into-truth-table
This project is a logical expression evaluator that processes Boolean expressions involving up to five variables. The program first prompts the user to enter the number of variables and a logical expression. Based on the number of variables, it initializes truth tables for each variable. Using a stack-based approach, it then parses and evaluates the given logical expression by applying the corresponding logical operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, implication, etc.). Finally, it prints the result of the evaluated expression. This tool can be useful for understanding and analyzing complex logical relationships in Boolean algebra.
